# Issue Mirror #

As part of the export process, either to GitHub or using the [Issue Exporter](IssueExporterTool.md) tool, issue attachments are presented as a link. This wiki describes how those links are generated.

All _public_ Google Code issue attachments are mirrored to [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/), in the bucket `google-code-attachments`.

You can access a project's issue attachments by generating a URL based on the issue's information. The format is as follows:

```
    "http://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-attachments" +
    "/" + project_name + 
    "/issue-" + issue_number +
    "/comment-" + comment_number +
    "/" + file_name
```

The end result will be a URL to the project's issue, for example:

http://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-attachments/issue-export-test/issue-4/comment-1/misc_file2.txt

If an attachment is added to the initial issue report, then it is considered to be at `comment_number` 0.

Note: There was a bug in an earlier version of the Issue Mirror, which caused comment numbers for issues mirrored to Google Cloud Storage to match Google Code. This only occurred if some of the comments on the issue were deleted, which occurred for < 5% of issue attachments. This issue has since been fixed.
