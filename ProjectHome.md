This project contains tools for exporting data from Google Code project hosting.

# Google Code Archive #
The Google Code Archive contains all the public Google Code data and will be served for years into the future.

# Google Code to GitHub Exporter #
The quickest way to export data from Google Code is to use the [Google Code-to-GitHub exporter](http://code.google.com/export-to-github/). This tool allows you to export any public Google Code repository to your GitHub account.

For more information, please see the [Exporter FAQ](GitHubExporterFAQ.md).

# Project Migration #
There are guides for migrating Google Code projects to other open-source hosting services:

  * [How to migrate a project to GitHub](MigratingToGitHub.md)
  * [How to migrate a project to Bitbucket](MigratingToBitbucket.md)
  * [How to migrate a project to SourceForge](MigratingToSourceForge.md)
  * [How to migrate a project to GitLab](MigratingToGitLab.md)

# Issue Tracker #
The Google Code Issue Tracker has been integrated with Google Takeout. There is a stand-alone tool for exporting an archive of a Google Code project's issues and importing them into GitHub or Bitbucket.

See [Issue Exporter](IssueExporterTool.md).

For information specifically about issue attachments, see [Issue Mirror](IssueMirror.md).

# Wiki Data #
Google Code's wiki format is non-standard. There is a stand-alone tool for converting Google Code's wiki format to GitHub-flavored Markdown.

See [Wiki-to-Markdown tool](WikiToMarkdownTool.md).
